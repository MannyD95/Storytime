# Storytime: A GenAI Narrative App
<br>

## Background <br>
The Intention with this application is to act as a proof of concept that we can randomly generate unique stories based on an uploaded .jpeg file. <br>
The idea came about after family members remarked how hard it was to get children's books at the library for my nephew. <br>
Ideally, after future iterations it could seamlessly generate short stories that are appropriate for someone his age. 
Also, I wanted to try my hand at web dev, thus the choice of using Flask and boilerplate HTML with some JS for async and backend communication

## Running the App <br>
As of writing, it is not hosted publically, so to run the app you would need to clone the repo locally and input a secret key and your own OpenAI API key

## Future Considerations/Roadmap <br>
As I become more skilled, I want to make this program more feature-complete, this will involve: <br>
> ability to fine tune narrative text based on reading level 
> incorporating AI image generation in combintion with text generation to remove the need for uploading and become one-button operational
> Finally, a toggle for genres and/or flavour text 
> Troubleshooting .png image previewing
